(def gui

     ;; GUI. Keyword parameters to this function will be:
     ;; :gui - gui to be modified, usually not needed for main window
     ;; :parent - parent object, usually not needed for main window
     ;; :parent-style - guiftw.styles.Style, containing parent object
     ;;   properties, usually not needed.
     ;; :stylesheets - sequence of guiftw.styles.Style objects with
     ;;   styles to be applied
     (swing
      ;; GUI structure is a tree. Each node begins with object's class
      ;; name, followed by private style sheet and children. In this
      ;; example JFrame will have only one child, a JButton.

				 ;; here, but for exemplary purposes,
				 ;; we only set id.

;; Properties that begin with * are not precisely properties (such as
;; text, color, font, etc.). *id is object's identifier. It'll be used
;; to find properties for it in style sheets. There's also *groups and
;; *cons special properties. *groups declares to which groups objects
;; belongs (which can be used in style sheets similarly to ids). *cons
;; declares constructor parameters.

;; Define style sheet number one.

     ;; Stylesheet macro (from guiftw.styles) returns a list of
     ;; precompiled styles.

      ;; Syntax of a style consits of list of ids and list of
      ;; properties. Ids are either identifiers of a single object or
      ;; group of objects.
      [:main-window] [;; Properties corresponds to setters, so you are
		      ;; not constrained to some fixed (by me) set of
		      ;; properties. Next line will be translated to
		      ;; .setTitle("...")
		      :title "First GUIFTW Window!"
		      
		      ;; unroll tag will tell GUI FTW that this setter
		      ;; have more than one argument. For example
		      ;; there is .setSize(width, height). Code below
		      ;; will be translated to .setSize(300, 200)
		      ;; instead of .setSize((300, 200)).
		      :size ^unroll (300 200)

		      ;; GUI FTW will prevent order in which
		      ;; properties are provided. This is the reason
		      ;; why they're not put in a map. Maps don't have

		      ;; after setting all properties.

		       ;; create a new class that implements some
		       ;; interface, for example MouseListener and
		       ;; then use addMouseListener(o) on object. GUI
		       ;; FTW does just that for you!
		       ;; mouse+mouse-clicked will be understood as
		       ;; "Implement mouseClicked method from
		       ;; MouseListener interface". When method name
		       ;; have the same prefix as listener name the
		       ;; shorthand is mouse++clicked.
