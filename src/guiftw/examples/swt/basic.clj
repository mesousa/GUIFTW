;; SWT is a little more complicated from programmers perspective than
;; Swing. You have to manually write a loop that dispaches events and
;; all SWT-related stuff have to happen in this loops thread. GUI FTW
;; have wrappers for this circumstanses:
;;
;; 1) swt-loop function so you don't have your own. If supplied a
;; shell parameter, loop will work until that shell (a window) is
;; closed.
;;
;; 2) swt-thread function that starts swt-loop in separate
;; thread. Convenient to use in REPL. Sometimes (I don't know why at
;; the moment) it'll end up constantly spitting illegal thread access
;; exceptions and REPL have to be restarted.
;;
;; 3) async-exec -- takes a function (and its parameters) that will be
;; invoked inside SWT loop, so it's legal to do SWT stuff in it.
;;
;; Additionally, default-display returns (Display/getDefault)

;; To open a window in REPL you could write:
;; (swt-thread)
;; (async-exec #(.open (:root @(gui :gui (default-display) :stylesheets[sheet])))

(defn start-in-repl [] ;; remember to (swt-thread) first!
  (async-exec #(.open (:root @(gui :gui (default-display) :stylesheets [sheet])))))


(defn -main [& args]
  (let [shell (gui :gui (default-display) :sytlesheets [sheet])]
    (.open shell) ;; Is there another way to show a shell?
    (swt-loop shell))) ;; Start SWT main loop that will stop program
		       ;; after shell is closed.
